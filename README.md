# Votic mini resource grammar for the GF RGL

This is an incomplete Votic language mini resource grammar for the [Grammatical Framework](http://grammaticalframework.org/) Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

It contains morphological paradigm functions for some Votic nouns. These functions have been automatically derived from inflection tables using the paradigm extracting tool [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) that are converted using the [pextract2gf](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf) tool.

No high-level morphology functions have been implemented, e.g there is no smart paradigm chooser yet for the ''mkNoun'' function of GF.

See my GF summer school 2017 [project write-up](https://github.com/keeleleek/GF-Votic/blob/master/GFSS2017-project-presentation.md) for more information on how this was created.

__This is work in progress!__

# Votic mini resource grammar for the GF RGL

This is a partial Votic mini resource grammar for the [Grammatical Framework](http://grammaticalframework.org/) Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

See my GF summer school 2017 [project write-up](https://github.com/keeleleek/GF-Votic/blob/master/GFSS2017-project-presentation.md) for more information on how it was created.

This work depends largely on the paradigm extracting tool [pextract](https://github.com/marfors/paradigmextract) and the convertor [pextract2gf](https://github.com/keeleleek/pextract2gf).

__This is work in progress!__

_See [http://vadda.keeleleek.ee/](http://vadda.keeleleek.ee/) for more Votic resources_
